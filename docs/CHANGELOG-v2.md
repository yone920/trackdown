# TrackDown v2 — changelog

One section per work package (`docs/build-plan.md`): what shipped, what was deferred, and
every decision that had to be made along the way. This file is the handover.

## Testing on the phone

```bash
cd ~/Work/trackdown
export REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=100.64.198.50   # Tailscale address of this VM
npx expo start --offline
```

Open **Expo Go** on the iPhone (Tailscale must be on and connected) and scan the QR, or
open `exp://100.64.198.50:8081` directly.

## WP0a — Email + password auth

Sign-in is email + password. v1's email-OTP flow is gone: there is no SMTP server, so the
6-digit code was never going to arrive.

**Backend**

- `src/auth.ts` — `emailOTP()` replaced by `emailAndPassword: { enabled: true,
  minPasswordLength: 8 }` (exported as `MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH`, mirrored by the app). The
  `bearer` plugin and the `profiles`-row creation hook are unchanged. Endpoints:
  `POST /api/auth/sign-up/email` (name, email, password — auto-signs in),
  `POST /api/auth/sign-in/email`, `POST /api/auth/sign-out`. The old
  `/api/auth/email-otp/*` and `/api/auth/sign-in/email-otp` now 404 (asserted in a test).
- `emailAndPassword.sendResetPassword` is deliberately **unset**: Better Auth then refuses
  `/request-password-reset` outright, which is honest while no mail server exists.
- `migrations/0003_account_issuer.sql` — Better Auth 1.7 requires `account."issuer"`
  (`local:credential` for email+password). 0001 predates it because the OTP flow never
  wrote an account row; email+password does, so the column had to exist before the first
  sign-up. Added nullable, backfilled `'local:' || "providerId"`, set NOT NULL, plus the
  unique `(issuer, accountId)` index Better Auth looks accounts up by.
  **Note for WP1: the schema-v2 migration is now `0004_v2.sql`, not `0003_v2.sql`.**
- `src/services/password.ts` + `src/scripts/reset-password.ts` —
  `npm run reset-password -- <email> <newPassword>`. Everything goes through
  `auth.$context`: `password.hash` (the exact hasher sign-in verifies with) and
  `internalAdapter.updatePassword` / `createAccount`, the same two branches Better Auth's
  own `/reset-password` takes. No hashing is written by hand. It also gives a v1 OTP-era
  account — a user row with no credential account at all — its first password.
- `src/ports/email.ts` (`EmailPort`) + `src/adapters/email/smtp.ts`
  (`createSmtpEmailer`) — the old `createSmtpOtpSender` generalised. Nothing sends mail
  today; the port is kept so password-reset emails have somewhere to land once SMTP
  exists. Without `SMTP_HOST` it logs the message instead of sending it (unit-tested).

**App**

- `lib/auth.ts` — `emailOTPClient` plugin removed; `signIn(email, password)` and
  `signUp(email, password)` replace `sendSignInCode` / `verifySignInCode`. `signUp` sends
  the email's local part as Better Auth's required `name`.
- `app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx` — one screen, two modes: a password field
  (`secureTextEntry`, min 8, checked client-side before the request) and a
  "No account yet? Create one" / "Already have an account? Sign in" toggle. Backend error
  messages are surfaced verbatim, so a duplicate sign-up reads "User already exists…".
  Kept in the existing cream/Fraunces style — WP6 restyles it.

**Decisions**

- Duplicate sign-up returns 422 `USER_ALREADY_EXISTS_USE_ANOTHER_EMAIL` rather than Better
  Auth's silent enumeration-protection response, because that response only applies with
  `requireEmailVerification` or `autoSignIn: false`, and neither is on. This is what the
  build plan asked for ("a clear already-exists error").
- New dependency `@better-auth/core@^1.7.2` (already installed transitively by
  `better-auth`) — for `createLocalAccountIssuer`, so the reset script writes the same
  issuer string Better Auth does instead of hard-coding `"local:credential"`.
- The OTP user row on the production database was **not** touched. Give it a password with
  the reset script.

**Tests** — `backend`: 21 passing (was 13). New/rewritten: sign-up creates user + profile,
sign-in with the right password, wrong password and unknown email both 401, password under
8 rejected, duplicate email rejected, sign-out kills the token, OTP endpoints 404, reset
script updates an existing password, reset script creates a first password for an OTP-era
account, reset script rejects unknown email / short password, SMTP console fallback.

**Deferred** — self-service password reset (needs SMTP), and the `EmailPort` is
implemented but not yet called from anywhere.

## WP0 — Ports & adapters

Third-party services now sit behind interfaces, so swapping one is an env var.

**New**

- `src/ports/llm.ts` — `LlmPort.parseStructured({ system, messages, schema, schemaName,
  maxTokens })`. Messages carry **text and images** (`{ type: "image", mediaType:
  "image/jpeg" | "image/png", base64 }`) even though only text is used today: WP2 sends a
  machine photo plus a spoken set/rep count as one call, and the port had to be designed for
  that now rather than widened later. Vision is folded in here — no separate `VisionPort`.
- `src/adapters/llm/anthropic.ts` — `messages.parse` + `zodOutputFormat`. Keeps the optional
  `anthropic-workspace-id` default header (`ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID`) that identity-linked
  keys require.
- `src/adapters/llm/openai.ts` — `responses.parse` + `zodTextFormat`, images as
  `input_image` data URLs. New dependency: `openai@^7.8.0` — the second adapter is what
  proves the port is an abstraction and not a rename.
- `src/adapters/llm/unavailable.ts` — the "no API key" adapter. A missing key must not stop
  the server booting (sign-in, manual logging, every CRUD endpoint are unaffected); it fails
  at the one call that needed it, naming the variable.
- `src/container.ts` — the composition root. Builds `llm`, `coachLlm` and `email` from
  config; a provider with no adapter throws.
- `src/test/fakes/llm.ts`, `src/test/fakes/email.ts` — the fakes integration tests use. The
  LLM fake validates through the caller's own schema, so it cannot return a shape the real
  provider could not.

**Changed**

- `services/parseLog.ts` is provider-neutral: it owns `SYSTEM_PROMPT` and the zod schema and
  exports `createLogParser(llm: LlmPort)`. `createClaudeLogParser` and its Anthropic import
  are gone. `LogParser` (what routes depend on) is unchanged.
- `config/index.ts` gained `LLM_PROVIDER`, `COACH_LLM_PROVIDER` (defaults to `LLM_PROVIDER`),
  `LLM_MODEL_FUSION`, `LLM_MODEL_COACH`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`. An unknown
  provider name throws at boot. Per-provider default models live in `config.llm.defaultModels`
  (anthropic `claude-haiku-4-5` / `claude-sonnet-4-5`, openai `gpt-4.1-mini` / `gpt-4.1`) —
  one source of truth, also used by the contract tests. `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` still works as an
  alias for `LLM_MODEL_FUSION` so the deployed `.env.production` keeps working.
- `eslint.config.js` — `no-restricted-imports` for `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `openai` and
  `nodemailer` (and their subpaths, e.g. `@anthropic-ai/sdk/helpers/zod`) everywhere except
  `src/adapters/**`. Verified by temporarily importing all four into `routes/log.ts`: 4
  errors; codebase clean again afterwards.
- `.env.example` and `docker-compose.yml` document and pass through the new variables.
  `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` and `EVIDENCE_STORAGE` are listed as "not read yet" — their ports
  arrive with WP8 and WP2 rather than as dead config now.

**Decisions**

- `schemaName` is part of the port because OpenAI's structured outputs require a
  model-visible schema name; the Anthropic adapter ignores it.
- OpenAI assistant-role messages with array content are flattened to text — assistant turns
  are context we wrote and never carry images, and the Responses API wants `output_text`
  there.
- Contract tests build their client lazily: an SDK constructed with an empty key throws, and
  that would fail the file instead of skipping it.

**Tests** — 28 passing, 2 skipped (was 21). New: 3 container tests (per-provider wiring,
missing key names the variable at the call, unknown provider refused), 2 `createLogParser`
tests over the fake port, and 2×2 adapter contract tests (structured parse + an image part,
checked against a 16×16 red PNG). `app.test.ts` now drives the real `parseLog` service over
the fake `LlmPort` instead of a fake `LogParser`, with every assertion unchanged.

**Deferred / uncertain**

- **The OpenAI contract tests have never run**: `backend/.env` has no `OPENAI_API_KEY`, so
  both skip. The adapter typechecks against the real SDK types, but "LLM_PROVIDER=openai
  parses with a real key" from the WP0 acceptance list is unverified, and the openai default
  model names are a reasonable guess rather than a tested value. Add a key and run
  `npm test` to close this.
- `CoachPort`, `TranscriptionPort` and `EvidenceStore` are not built — they would be empty
  interfaces with no caller. They arrive with WP5, WP8 and WP2.
